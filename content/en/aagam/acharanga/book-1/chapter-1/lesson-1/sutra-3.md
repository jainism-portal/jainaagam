## Meaning

Now this is what one should know, either by one's own knowledge or through the instruction of the highest (i.e. a TÃ®rthakara), or having heard it from others: that he descended in an eastern direction, or in any other direction (particularised above). Similarly, some know that their soul is born again and again, that it arrives in this or that direction, whatever direction that may be.
