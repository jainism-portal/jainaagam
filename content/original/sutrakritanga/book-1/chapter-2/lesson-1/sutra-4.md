जमिणं जगई पुढो जगा, कम्मेहिं लुप्पंति पाणिणो ।
सयमेव कडेहिं गाहइ, णो तस्स मुच्चे अपुट्ठवं ॥ ४ ॥

<!-- ## Meaning

For in this world living beings suffer individually for their deeds; for the deed they have done themselves, they obtain (punishment), and will not get over it before they have felt it. -->
