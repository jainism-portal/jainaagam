## तइओ उद्देसओ 

## 1 

### en
(Thus I say): He who acts rightly, who does pious work, who practises no deceit, is called houseless. (1) 

## 2
जाय सद्धाए णिक्खंतो तमेव अणुपालिया विजहित्ता विसोत्तियं। 
 
पणया वीरा महावीहिं । 

जिस श्रद्धा से (निष्ठा/वैराग्य भाव से) संयम-पथ पर कदम बढ़ाया है, उसी श्रद्धा से संयम का पालन करें। 

One should, conquering the world, persevere in that (vigour of) faith which one had on the entrance in the order; the heroes (of faith), humbly bent, (should retain their belief in) the illustrious road (to final liberation) and in the world (of water-bodies); having rightly comprehended them through the instruction (of Mahâvîra), (they should retain) that which causes no danger (i.e. self-control). Thus I say. (2) 

## २२. 
लोगं च आणाए अभिसमेच्चा अकुतोभयं । से बेमि — णेव सय॑ लोगं अब्भाइक्खेज्जा, णेव अत्ताणं अब्भाइक्खेज्जा ।

जे लोगं अब्भाइक्खति से अत्ताणं अब्भाइक्खति, जे अत्ताणं अब्भाइक्खति से लोगं अब्भाइक्खति ।

A man should not (himself) deny the world of (water-bodies), nor should he deny the self. He who denies the world (of water-bodies), denies the self; and he who denies the self, denies the world of (water-bodies). (3)

## २३. 
लज्जमाणा पुढो पास । 

'अणगारा मो' त्ति एगेपवयमाणा, जमिणं विरूवरूवेहिं सत्थेहिं उदयकम्मसमारंभेणं उदयसत्थं समारंभमाणे अण्णे वSणेगरूवे पाणे विहिंसति । 

See! there are men who control themselves; others pretend only to be houseless; for one destroys this (water-body) by bad, injurious doings, and many other beings, besides, which he hurts by means of water, through his doing acts relating to water. (4)

## २४. 
तत्थ खलु भगवता परिण्णा पवेदिता — इमस्स चेव जीवितस्स परिवंदण-माणण-पूयणाए जाती-मरण-मोयणाए दुक्खपडिघातहेतुं से सयमेव उदयसत्थं समारभति, अण्णेहिं वा उदयसत्थं समारभावेति, अण्णे वा उद्यसत्थं समारभंते समणुजाणति । 

तं से अहिताए तं से अबोधीए । 

About this the Revered One has taught the truth: for the sake of the splendour, honour, and glory of this life, for the sake of birth, death, and final liberation, for the removal of pain, man acts sinfully towards water, or causes others to act so, or allows others to act so. (5) 

## २५. 
से त्तं संबुज्झमाणे आयाणीयं समुट्ठटाए सोच्चा भगवतो अणगाराणं इहमेगेसिं णातं भवति-एस खलु गंथे, एस खलु मोहे, एस खलु मारे, एस खलु निरए । 

इच्चत्थं गढिए लोए, जमिणं विरूवरूवेहिं सत्थेहिं उदयकम्मसमारंभेणं उदयसत्थं समारभमाणे अण्णे वSणेगरूवे पाणे विहिंसति । 

This deprives him of happiness and perfect wisdom. About this he is informed when he has understood and heard from the Revered One, or from the monks, the faith to be coveted. There are some who, of a truth, know this (i.e. injuring) to be the bondage, the delusion, the death, the hell. For this a man is longing when he destroys this (water-body) by bad and injurious doings, and many other beings, besides, which he hurts by means of water, through his doing acts relating to water. Thus I say. (6)

## २६. 
से बेमि — संति पाणा उदयणिस्सिया जीवा अणेगा । इहं च खलु भो अणगाराणं उदयं जीवा वियाहिया । 

सत्थं चेत्थ अणुवीयि पास । 

पुढो सत्थ॑ पवेदितं । 

अदुवा अदिण्णादाणं । 

There are beings living in water, many lives; of a truth, to the monks water has been declared to be living matter. See! considering the injuries (done to water-bodies), those acts (which are injuries, but must be done before the use of water, eg. straining) have been distinctly declared. Moreover he (who uses water which is not strained) takes away what has not been given (i.e. the bodies of water-lives). (A Bauddha will object): 'We have permission, we have permission to drink it, or (to take it) for toilet purposes.' Thus they destroy by various injuries (the water-bodies). But in this their doctrine is of no authority. 
He who injures these (water-bodies) does not comprehend and renounce the sinful acts; he who does not injure these, comprehends and renounces the sinful acts. (7) 

## २७. 
कप्पइ णे कप्पइ णे पातुं, अदुवा विभूसाए । 

पुढो सत्थेहिं विउट्टंति । 

एत्थ वि तेसिं णो णिकरणाए । 

## २९ 
एत्थ सत्थ॑ समारभमाणस्स इच्चेते आरंभा अपरिण्णाया भवंति ।

एत्थ सत्थं असमारभमाणस्स इच्चेते आरंभा परिण्णाया भवंति । 

तं परिण्णाय मेहावी णेव सयं उदयसत्थं समारभेज्जा, णेवण्णेहिं उदयसत्थं समारभावेज्जा, उदयसत्थं समारभंते वि अण्णे ण समणुजाणेज्जा । 

जस्सेते उदयसत्थसमारंभा परिण्णाया भवंति से हु मुणी परिण्णातकम्मे त्ति बेमि ।

॥ सत्थपरिण्णाए तइओ उद्देसओ समत्तो ॥ 

Knowing them, a wise man should not act sinfully towards water, nor cause others to act so, nor allow others to act so. 

He who knows these causes of sin relating to water, is called a reward-knowing sage. Thus I say. (8)
