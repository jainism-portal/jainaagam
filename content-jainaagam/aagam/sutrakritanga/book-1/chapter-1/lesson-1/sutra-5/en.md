<sutra-meaning>

Like money and siblings, all this does not protect. Doubting similarly about life, one must become free from the karma.

<sutra-explanation>

Money and family are important. But their role is limited when it comes to liberating your own soul. To shed your own karmic bondage, none of this helps. Rather, nothing external to the soul can protect the soul. In other words, soul itself should protect itself. ‚òùüèª

Even life is ephemeral. So like money and siblings cannot help you in your journey of becoming free from karmic bondage, even life --- howsoever pleasant it may seem --- cannot protect you in liberating the soul.

So, what's the next best alternative? Be free from the karmic bondage. One who is free from karma, doesn't need any protecting. üòä
