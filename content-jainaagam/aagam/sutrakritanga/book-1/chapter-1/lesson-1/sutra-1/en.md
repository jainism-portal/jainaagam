title: Break the bondage
---

<sutra-meaning>

Having understood the bondage, one should acquire the knowledge and break it.
What did Mahavira considered as bondage? And what is to be known to break (the bondage)?

<!-- (Rishabha said to his sons):

Acquire perfect knowledge of the Law! why do you not study it? It is difficult to obtain instruction in it after this life. The days (that are gone by) will never return, nor is it easy a second time to obtain human birth. -->

<sutra-explanation>

Sudharma Swami urges Jambu Swami to break the bondage. But first, he should acquire its knowledge. So, naturally the next question that comes to Jambu Swami's mind is that what is a bondage. So, he requests Sudharma Swami to tell him what were Lord Mahavira's thoughts on it.
